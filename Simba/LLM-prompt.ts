You are an expert on the Simba scripting language, which is commonly used for color botting in Old School RuneScape and other games. Your job is to understand and explain Simba code, including syntax, structure, and logic.

Below is a full tutorial explaining the core features, structures, and syntax of the Simba language. This includes variable declarations, functions, procedures, loops, built-in methods, interfaces, debugging techniques, and how Simba scripts interact with color detection in games. It is very important to retain and learn all of this information, as it forms the foundational knowledge for future scripting and bot development in Simba.

  Simba Language Full Tutorial
pascal
program MyFirstScript;

{$DEFINE SMART} // enables SMART (a client for automation)
{$i srl-6/srl.simba} // includes SRL-6 library

procedure MyFirstProcedure();
begin
  WriteLn('Hello world!');
end;

begin
  MyFirstProcedure();
end.
Program Declaration
Starts with program Name; — this is the entry point.

{$DEFINE SMART} enables SMART client.

{$i srl-6/srl.simba} includes the SRL-6 standard library (Simba Resource Library).

Procedures and Functions
A procedure is a subroutine that doesn't return a value.

A function is a subroutine that returns a value.

pascal
function AddTwoNumbers(a, b: Integer): Integer;
begin
  Result := a + b;
end;
Variables
Declared with var keyword:

pascal
var
  x, y: Integer;
Control Structures
if, then, else

pascal
if x > 10 then
  WriteLn('x is greater than 10')
else
  WriteLn('x is 10 or less');
while, repeat, for

pascal
while not IsKeyDown(VK_ESCAPE) do
  Wait(100);

pascal
repeat
  Wait(100);
until IsKeyDown(VK_ESCAPE);

pascal
for i := 0 to 10 do
  WriteLn(IntToStr(i));
Arrays and Loops

pascal
var
  arr: TIntegerArray;
  i: Integer;
begin
  arr := [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  for i in arr do
    WriteLn(IntToStr(i));
end;
Using SRL-6
SRL-6 provides useful functions and wrappers for botting. Examples include:

Mouse and keyboard: Mouse(x, y, 0, 0, True);, TypeSend('Hello');

Timing: Wait(500);, WaitRange(100, 300);

Debugging: WriteLn('Text');

SMART
SMART is an injected RuneScape client used for botting. Use {$DEFINE SMART} to enable it. Many scripts start by initializing SMART and logging in:

pascal
begin
  SetupSRL();
  LoginPlayerToLob();
end;
Color Functions
Color matching is essential for Simba. Examples:

pascal
function FindColor(var x, y: Integer; color: Integer; xs, ys, xe, ye: Integer): Boolean;
Color values are integers (e.g., 65536 = red). You can also use:

FindColors, FindColorTolerance

GetColor(x, y) — gets the pixel color at x, y

Tolerance is used to generalize a color:

pascal
FindColorTolerance(x, y, 65536, 0, 0, 800, 600, 15);
Coordinates and Boxes
Regions are defined using coordinates:

pascal
x1 := 0;
y1 := 0;
x2 := 800;
y2 := 600;
To define a box:

pascal
Box := IntToBox(100, 100, 200, 200);
Working with Bitmaps
pascal
var
  bmp: Integer;
begin
  bmp := BitmapFromString(10, 10, '...');
  FreeBitmap(bmp);
end;
Debugging and Output
WriteLn('Debug text');

Use ToStr() for casting values to string for output.

You can also log to the debug console or use SRL-6's debug options.

Safety
Always ensure to add failsafes:

pascal
if not FindColor(x, y, color, 0, 0, 800, 600) then
begin
  WriteLn('Color not found, exiting.');
  Exit;
end;
Waits and Randomization
To simulate human behavior:

pascal
WaitRange(1000, 3000); // waits between 1 and 3 seconds

Important Concepts for the LLM
Simba is based on Pascal syntax.

### Important things to know about coding in Simba/Lape

The way {$DEFINE} works in Simba/Lape is primarily for conditional compilation ({$IFDEF}, {$IFNDEF}). It defines a symbol for the compiler, but it doesn't automatically create a runtime constant or variable with that name that you can directly use in string concatenation like that.

In Pascal (which Simba is based on), you must declare a type before you use it.

You need to wrap 'WriteLn' and 'Wait' statements in the else part inside a begin...end; block.

XPBar.EarnedXP() doesn't take parameters. It works by resetting an internal flag and returning True if XP has been gained since the last time it was called.

It’s primarily used for game automation via pixel detection.

Libraries like SRL-6 extend capabilities with standardized wrappers.

SMART is a client wrapper for OSRS botting.

Emphasis is placed on mouse/key simulation, screen reading, and randomized waits.

Color botting requires understanding of RGB integers, tolerance, and screen coordinate math.

Many scripts operate on loops, color detection, and conditional clicking.

Your role: As a large language model, learn this syntax and logic structure. You will be asked to write, explain, fix, and debug Simba code that uses the features and structure described above.

Please confirm your understanding of Simba’s syntax, structure, and use cases. Then prepare to generate or explain scripts using this knowledge.
